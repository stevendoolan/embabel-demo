# Updates 
## Steven's Update 3 SEP 2025: Jasper Blues fixed it!
Thanks very much Jasper Blues for fixing my broken repo!

The problem was the test dependency using 0.1.2-SNAPSHOT.  Removing this fixed the problems listed below.
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.embabel.agent</groupId>
            <artifactId>embabel-agent-test</artifactId>
            <!-- This is later than agent version, but will come back in sync in future -->
            <version>0.1.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
```

## Steven's Update 2 SEP 2025: I broke it and I don't know how! :(

My first error was:
```
Web application could not be started as there was no
org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.server.ServletWebServerFactory bean defined in the context.
```

I fixed this by adding into [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties):
```
spring.main.web-application-type=none
```

Now it won't start, with a new error:
```
Parameter 1 of constructor in 
com.embabel.agent.mcpserver.support.PerGoalMcpToolExportCallbackPublisher 
required a bean of type 'io.modelcontextprotocol.server.McpSyncServer' 
that could not be found.
```

I think it was the refactor where I changed the base package from `com.embabel.template` to `com.embabel.demo`.

I took a fresh template and less refactors. Please see https://github.com/stevendoolan/embabel-demo2

# Generated agent

Java agent repository generated by the Embabel project creator.

Starting point for your own agent development using the [Embabel framework](https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent).

Add your magic here!

Illustrates:

- An injected demo showing how any Spring component can be injected with an Embabel `Ai` instance to enable it to
  perform LLM operations.
- A simple agent
- Unit tests for an agent verifying prompts and hyperparameters

# To run

Run the shell script to start Embabel under Spring Shell:

```bash
./scripts/shell.sh
```

There is a single example agent, `WriteAndReviewAgent`.
It uses one LLM with a high temperature and creative persona to write a story based on your input,
then another LLM with a low temperature and different persona to review the story.

When the Embabel shell comes up, use the story agent like this:

```
x "Tell me a story about...[your topic]"
```

Try the `InjectedDemo` command to see simple, non-agent use:

```java
animal
```

## A2A Support

Embabel integrates with the [A2A](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A) protocol, allowing you to connect to other
A2A-enabled agents and
services.

> Embabel agents can be exposed to A2A with zero developer effort.

Check out the `a2a` branch of this repository to try A2A support.

You'll need the following environment variable:

- `GOOGLE_STUDIO_API_KEY`: Your Google Studio API key, which is used for Gemini.

Start the Google A2A web interface using Docker compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Go to the web interface running within the container at `http://localhost:12000/`.

Connect to your agent at `host.docker.internal:8080/a2a`. Note that `localhost:8080/a2a` won't work as the server
cannot access it when running in a Docker container.

Your agent will have automatically been exported to A2A. Add it in the UI, and start a chat.
You should see something like this:
